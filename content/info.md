hi, this is mike. I love computers. I have been on the computer since roughly the start of this millenium. I created this website to share stuff that I am doing on the computer. Stuff like, writing Rust, creating apps, doing puzzles.

I am a programmer by trade. Professionally engaged with embedded C right now but I like writing Rust, Javascript, and occasional Python as well. Mostly passionate about Rust though.

I read a lot, so this blog will also have ideas I have come across while reading, and the things I think up after applying my brain thoughts on those ideas.

probably github.com/rland93 is the best place to reach me.
