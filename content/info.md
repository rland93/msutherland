![the author](/img/mike.jpg)

My name is Mike. I love computers. I have been on the computer since roughly the start of this millenium. I created this website to share stuff that I am doing on the computer. Stuff like: writing Rust, making hardware, writing firmware.

I am a programmer. Professionally engaged with embedded C right now and I like writing Rust (both no_std and std), Javascript (Svelte), and a smattering of Python.

I read a lot, so this blog will also have ideas I have come across while reading, and the things I think up after applying my brain thoughts on those ideas.

probably github.com/rland93 is the best place to reach me.
