![The author](/img/surf.jpg)

My name is Mike. I love computers. I created this website to share stuff that I am doing on the computer. Stuff like: writing Rust, making hardware, writing firmware. I am a programmer. Professionally engaged with embedded C right now and I like writing Rust (both no_std and std), Javascript (vanilla JS, little bit of Svelte). Ocasionally, I write Python. I have a few projects which range from embedded stuff all the way up to web technologies.

I read a lot, so this blog will also have ideas I have come across while reading, and the things I think up after applying my brain thoughts on those ideas.

probably github.com/rland93 is the best place to reach me.
