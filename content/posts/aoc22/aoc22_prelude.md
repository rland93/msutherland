## Prelude

This is the first post in a series of (hopefully 50!) posts. I am going to use the Advent of Code as my "homework" for learning the systems programming language Rust. Advent of Code is a thing that some smart people do every year where they come up with a series of clever puzzles and then release them every day for 25 days, starting on December 1.

<!--more-->

They do this every year, so I'm going to start with 2022, since all the solutions are known and there's a lot of discussion about them, which should provide ample ground for hints if I get stuck.

## What's my goal here?

One of my goals in 2023 is to learn the systems programming language Rust. I've finally been convinced by you ~~~crab people~~~ Rust evangelists of its utility, and I can see that the language has some staying power. I recently got hired as a programmer here in San Diego; I'm working primarily in C on a fairly complex embedded codebase, which has certainly been fun and interesting so far!

I would like to continue programming as a hobby and to build some more general computer science skills outside of work, though, so I aim to work slowly through Advent of Code this year where I have time. I want to do 6-8 hours of programming and writing per week on this project. If I spent 6-8 hours per week at the gym this year, I would be in good shape by the end of the year; so if I do this for 6-8 hours a week, I'll be in shape at communication and at programming, and at Rust.

I have a few goals:

1. Learn the Rust programming language.
2. Be good at data structures and algorithms fundamentals.
3. Be good at communicating a technical process. Understanding the problem, whiteboarding/brainstorming, roadblocks, and solutions.
4. Make a journal of my solving these problems so that later I can look back on how obvious and easy they are and how dumb I used to be!
5. Have some fun and practice writing.

## How this series will look

There's going to be a few common sections.

The first section is the problem description. If I don't have any trouble understanding my task here, I will probably just link the AoC problem. If the problem is particularly thorny or I need to write it down to fully internalize it, I will write it down in this section.

The next section will be the initial approach: here, I will describe in pseudocode my white-board thoughts on how I will approach the problem, along with any algorithm notes. I haven't formally studied algorithms & datastructures, so this is the place where I'm doing my "homework." I think this will really help me build the hard "computer science" communication and problem solving skills that are commonly tested in e.g. technical interviews. I know these problems are tricky in general, so this should be good homework.

I will try to break the problem down to pieces and explain each piece. If I'm stuck, I might try to get a hint to the problem or view the solution.

If I get sick of whiteboarding, I'll probably dive into the code for some of the sections I understand.

Then, we'll get to implementation. Here I want to walk through what I did to solve the problem. What did I learn? What things were unexpected or surprising? Where did I get the solution from?

Finally, the last section will be notes and reflections about the process.
