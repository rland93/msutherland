    Project Name: Ollie FC
    Objective: Build a flight computer from scratch using embedded Rust.
    Purpose:
        Explore engineering design and embedded systems through a hands-on project.
        Evaluate the suitability of Rust for complex embedded systems beyond basic applications.
        Engage with RC planes, focusing on the design and automation aspects rather than manual control.
    Long-Term Goals:
        Apply control systems and feedback control knowledge to a practical project.
        Design a glider capable of maximizing flight time by efficiently loitering in a single area.
    Methodology:
        Document the project through YouTube vlogs to track progress.
        Write blog posts for in-depth exploration of conceptual topics not suited for video content.
    Project Significance:
        Offers a personal challenge and a platform for learning and applying embedded Rust.
        Aims to combine technical skills with a passion for RC aviation in an innovative way.



    Custom Hardware Decision:
        Inspired by professional experience and project cancellation.
        Focus on custom hardware for reliability and design challenges.
    Challenges with Prototyping:
        Unreliable mechanical connections in prototype stages.
        The necessity for a more stable and efficient design solution.
    PCB Design Journey:
        Motivated to explore PCBs after discovering cost-effective production options.
        Self-taught PCB design in three months, leveraging resources like Hacker News articles and JLCPCB services.
    Design Process Insights:
        Emphasizes the accessibility and affordability of PCB design for hobbyists and students.
        Highlights the engaging aspects of PCB design, including schematic view and routing.
        Differentiates between low-speed and high-speed board design requirements.
    Software and Tools:
        Utilized KiCad, an open-source EDA tool, for PCB design.
        Distinguished the simplicity of low-speed designs suitable for beginners.
    Challenges and Learnings:
        Encountered a critical mistake by omitting the boot pin in the first PCB design iteration.
        Adjusted design in the second revision, emphasizing the learning curve and the cost-effective nature of the mistake.
    Next Steps:
        Awaiting the second revision of the Ollie FC board from production.
        Plans for a detailed introduction to the V2 board in upcoming posts.
