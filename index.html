    <h1>mike's website</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is mike sutherland. You're on my website it's named mike
      suther.land, after me. I really like computers. Computers are my passion in life.</p>

    <p>I currently work primarily in embedded C. I get paid to do that. However, I
      am very excited about Rust. And I do some full-stack ish stuff on the side.
      Web Apps, Desktop Apps, stuff like that.</p>

    <p>I also like to write. I started really getting serious about writing in 2023.</p>

    <h2>writes</h2>
    <p>Here is a list of my writes. A write is a thing I (never a machine!) have written. I hope you enjoy reading
      some of my writes:</p>
    <ul class="writes">
      <li><span class="date">2023 nov</span><a href="writes/2023/datasheet.html">read the datasheet</a></li>
